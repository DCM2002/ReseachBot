Custom ResearchBot using LLMs and RAGs

Overview
This project is an End-to-End Generative AI ResearchBot built using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The bot retrieves relevant research documents and generates insightful responses based on user queries.

Features
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate responses.
Indexing research papers and documents for efficient search.
Query processing and natural language understanding using LLMs.
Summarization and key insights extraction from retrieved documents.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of GenAI with RAG for research assistance, enabling better document retrieval and summarization for academic or industry use.
